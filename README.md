## Overview of Election Audit
The Colorado Elections Board asked us to perform an election audit of a congressional election. That audit is composed of : 
1-The number of votes that were casted in that election.
2-A breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
3-The county that had the most votes
4-A breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
5-The candidate who won the election, its vote count and its percentage of the total votes

## Election-Audit results
In that congressional election 369,711 votes were casted. The precinct is divided into three counties : Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe. In the Jefferson county, it's 38,855 votes that were casted.It represents 10.51% of the total votes. It was 306,055 votes in Denver (82.78%) and 24,801 votes in Arapahoe (6.71%). With those results, we can see that the Denver county had the most votes. The three candidate were: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette and Raymon Anthony Doane. Mr. Stockham received 23% of the votes (85,213), Mrs. DeGette got 73.8% of the votes (272,892) and Mr.Doane had 3.1% of the votes (11,606).
